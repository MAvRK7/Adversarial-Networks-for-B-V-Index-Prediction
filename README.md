## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores **three adversarial deep learning frameworks**:  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  
- **Conditional GANs (CGANs)**  
- **Contrastive GANs (ContraGANs)**  

The goal is to generate **synthetic astronomical data** for predicting the **Bâ€‘V colour index**, a key stellar classification metric.  
We evaluate how advanced adversarial techniques can improve **data quality, predictive accuracy, and statistical alignment** in scientific datasets.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology
Models were trained and evaluated on an astronomical dataset (`apass9_cleaned.csv`) using:

- **Predictive Accuracy**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score  
- **Clustering Quality**: Silhouette Score, Calinskiâ€‘Harabasz Score, Daviesâ€‘Bouldin Score  
- **Statistical Alignment**: Wasserstein Distance, Kolmogorovâ€‘Smirnov Statistic

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

| Model       | MSE     | RÂ²     | Silhouette | Calinskiâ€‘Harabasz | Daviesâ€‘Bouldin |
|-------------|---------|--------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **ContraGAN** | **0.1250** | **0.7320** | **0.3723** | **272.0709** | **1.0491** |
| CGAN        | Higher MSE, lower clustering scores than ContraGAN, but strong overall performance due to feature conditioning |
| GAN         | Weakest performance across all metrics |

**Highlights:**
- **ContraGAN** significantly outperformed both GAN and CGAN across all evaluation metrics.
- **CGAN** benefited from conditioning on input features, improving predictive accuracy over standard GANs.
- **Standard GANs** struggled with both prediction and clustering quality.

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways
- **Contrastive learning + conditional generation** can dramatically improve synthetic data quality in scientific applications.
- The approach is **transferable** to other domains where labelled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.
- Demonstrates **endâ€‘toâ€‘end ML workflow**: data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and result interpretation.
