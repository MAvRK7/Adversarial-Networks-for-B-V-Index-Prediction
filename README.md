## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project evaluates **three adversarial deep learning frameworks** for generating synthetic astronomical data to predict the **Bâ€‘V colour index** â€” a key stellar classification metric:

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  
- **Conditional GANs (CGANs)**  
- **Contrastive GANs (ContraGANs)**  

The models were assessed on **predictive accuracy**, **clustering quality**, and **statistical alignment**.  
**ContraGAN** achieved the best overall performance, demonstrating the benefits of **contrastive learning** and **conditional generation** for producing highâ€‘fidelity synthetic data in scientific applications.

## ðŸ›° Dataset
- **Source**: AAVSO Photometric Allâ€‘Sky Survey (APASS) Data Release 9  
- **Coverage**: ~62 million stars, Johnson B, V and Sloan gâ€², râ€², iâ€² photometry  
- **Magnitude Range**: 7 â‰¤ V â‰¤ 17  
- **Subset Used**: 1,000 entries with RA, Dec, Bâ€‘V index, magnitude uncertainties, and quality flags  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Median imputation for missing values (7â€“9% missing across bands)
  - Normalization to [0, 1]
  - Kâ€‘Means clustering (elbow method) for conditional generation
  - Train/val/test split: 70% / 15% / 15%

## ðŸ§ª Methodology
Each adversarial framework was implemented with tailored architectural and training strategies:

### **1. GAN (WGANâ€‘GP)**
- Residual blocks in generator & discriminator
- Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty for stability
- Cosine decay learning rate schedule

### **2. CGAN**
- Conditional residual blocks with astronomical features (RA, Dec, magnitudes, errors, observation counts)
- Conditioning applied to both generator & discriminator
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay

### **3. ContraGAN**
- Builds on CGAN with **contrastive loss** to maximise featureâ€‘space separation between real & synthetic data
- Encourages diversity and structural coherence in generated samples

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ²
- **Clustering Quality**: Silhouette Score, Calinskiâ€‘Harabasz Score, Daviesâ€‘Bouldin Score
- **Statistical Alignment**: Wasserstein Distance, Kolmogorovâ€‘Smirnov Statistic

| Model       | MSE     | RÂ²     | Silhouette (Synth) | Calinskiâ€‘Harabasz (Synth) | Daviesâ€‘Bouldin (Synth) | Wasserstein Dist. | KS Stat |
|-------------|---------|--------|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **ContraGAN** | **0.1294** | **0.7258** | **0.3687**         | **269.1548**              | **1.0537**             | **0.1983**        | **0.3462** |
| CGAN        | 0.1498  | 0.6788 | 0.3360              | 238.9475                   | 1.2112                 | 0.2148            | 0.3535  |
| GAN         | 0.3461  | 0.2580 | 0.2992              | 224.7939                   | 1.3581                 | 0.3666            | 0.3695  |

**Highlights**:
- **ContraGAN** delivered the lowest MSE and highest RÂ², with superior clustering and statistical alignment.
- **CGAN** improved over vanilla GAN by leveraging feature conditioning.
- **GAN** struggled to capture complex feature relationships.
